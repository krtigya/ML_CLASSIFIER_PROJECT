This project focuses on analyzing customer feedback and reviews of the "MyWorldLink" App using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques. The primary goal is to automatically classify user sentiments — such as positive, negative, or neutral — based on textual reviews collected from customers.

The system leverages Python, NLTK, and Scikit-learn for text preprocessing, feature extraction, and model training. Various machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest are evaluated to identify the most accurate model for sentiment classification.

Additionally, the project includes a robust preprocessing pipeline that filters out Nepali or Hindi (Devanagari) text, removes emojis, punctuations, and stopwords, and performs tokenization and lemmatization to ensure clean and consistent input for the model. A SQLite database is used to store both raw and processed data efficiently.

The final trained model is tested on a separate dataset of MyWorldLink app reviews to evaluate its real-world performance. The system can be used to monitor customer satisfaction, identify key issues, and improve overall service quality through data-driven insights.# Sentiment & Suggestion Classification Project
