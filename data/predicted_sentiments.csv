Some suggestions to make the app more better and useful. 1. Please make it possible to see Internet usage on particular device rather than just overall download and upload speed.  2. Make it possible to filter MAC address. 3. Separate bandwidth control for WiFi only not just the overall connection. Please consider implementing the given suggestions.,NEGATIVE
